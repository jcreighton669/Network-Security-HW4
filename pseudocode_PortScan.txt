				Ports Scan
-----------------------------------------------
Populate array to iterate through ports 1 - 65536 (inclusively)
Start stopwatch
PortScan the ports numbered in the array
	If the result is an open port:
		Add port number to open_array
		Get protocol service for the open port
		Add the port and the service to the dictionary
	Else
		?
Stop stopwatch

For open ports_array
	Iterate through and assign ports to the proper line, (4096, 8192, 12288, etc.)
	For line:
		index  = (port_num // 256) + 1
		Append index to line_array
		Count the number of instances of an indidual number in line_array
			If instance number > 1:
				add instance_number of "!" to line_string
			If instance number = 1:
				add 1 "!" to line_string
			Else:
				Add "." to line_string
		Count number of "." for line_string
			If number of "." is < 16:
				Add "." until 16 in line_string
	Print line_string

Print stats for Scan
	Print number of ports found
	Print total time
	Print scan rate
